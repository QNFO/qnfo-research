## Abstract

QWAV Quantum Software possesses a validated technical differentiator — the JPCUB (Joules-per-Solution) energy-efficiency benchmark — but the SaaS go-to-market model carries a structural weakness: incumbents will integrate energy benchmarking into their own platforms within 12–36 months, and a single independent researcher selling B2B software faces adoption friction from both sides (buyers distrust vendor benchmarks; competitors will not pay a competitor for benchmarking). This paper proposes an alternative: the **JPCUB Consortium model**, where QWAV is the neutral steward of a multi-stakeholder standards body, combined with **grant-funded core R&D** that covers the development valley between technical validation and consortium sustainability. Key contributions: (1) a consortium governance architecture with three membership tiers (Academic, Industry, Regulatory Observer); (2) a grant-funding landscape map targeting EU Quantum Flagship, NWO, Quantum Delta NL, and private foundations; (3) a certification model where the "product" is a JPCUB-verified badge — a credential, not a subscription; (4) a combined financial model projecting sustainability at €120K–€400K/year within 24–36 months; and (5) seven pre-registered falsifiable predictions with disconfirmation conditions anchored to consortium membership growth rather than SaaS revenue.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The SaaS Model's Structural Weakness

The prior draft of this strategy paper proposed a three-tier SaaS revenue model: Free ($0), Professional ($49–99/mo), Enterprise ($499–2,499/mo). This model has a structural problem.

A benchmarking product sold by a single vendor faces two adoption barriers:

1. **Trust:** A buyer evaluating quantum hardware has no reason to trust a single-vendor benchmark — especially one sold by an entity with its own computational primitive (p-adic algorithms). The vendor-benchmark conflict of interest is structural, not mitigatable by disclosure.

2. **Competitor exclusion:** IBM, Google, and Amazon will not pay a competitor for benchmarking. They will build their own — faster, with more resources, and with the distribution advantage of existing cloud platforms.

The SaaS model's revenue ceiling ($45K–$1.2M ARR at 12–24 months) is sustainability-scale for an independent researcher, but it does not survive the competitive window. The JPCUB differentiator as a standalone product is defensible for 12–36 months — the exact period needed to build a consortium that outlasts it.

### 1.2 The Consortium Model's Structural Advantage

A consortium transforms JPCUB from a **product** (that competes with incumbents) into a **standard** (that incumbents can join). Standards outlast products. The JPCUB Consortium positions QWAV not as a competitor to IBM/Google but as the neutral steward of a metric they all benefit from adopting.

| Property | SaaS Model | Consortium Model |
|:---------|:-----------|:-----------------|
| Trust signal | "Vendor selling a benchmark" | "Neutral standards body" |
| Incumbent relationship | Competitor | Potential member |
| Adoption mechanism | Sales (push) | Membership (pull) |
| Revenue model | Subscription fees | Membership dues + certification fees + grants |
| Competitive defensibility | Weak (copied in 12–36 months) | Strong (shared governance resists displacement) |
| Alignment with independent researcher | Poor (B2B sales) | Excellent (steward, not salesperson) |

### 1.3 Core Claim (Revised)

> The JPCUB Consortium model, combined with grant-funded core R&D, is the superior go-to-market strategy for QWAV. It transforms the JPCUB benchmark from a single-vendor product into a multi-stakeholder standard, aligns with the independent-researcher profile of the founder, and creates a defensible position that survives incumbent integration of energy benchmarking. The primary risk is not technical but organizational — the consortium must achieve critical mass (≥3 institutional members) before incumbents launch competing standards.

## 2. Strategy Corpus Audit

*[Section 2 unchanged from v0.1 — the eight existing QWAV papers, six execution gaps, and novelty confirmation remain valid. See v0.1 for full text.]*

The six execution gaps identified in v0.1 (GTM Tactical, R&D Pipeline, Market Intelligence, Competitive Positioning, Revenue Model, Falsifiability) remain — but the consortium model addresses the GTM and Revenue gaps with a fundamentally different approach than the SaaS model.

## 3. Market Analysis and Competitive Positioning

### 3.1 Why Energy Benchmarking Needs a Standard

The quantum computing market is entering a phase where energy efficiency will become a procurement criterion. Three forces drive this:

1. **Regulatory pressure:** EU Energy Efficiency Directive (2023 recast), US Executive Order on Sustainable Computing, and emerging ESG mandates make energy benchmarking mandatory in technology procurement within 3–7 years.
2. **Economic pressure:** A dilution-refrigerator quantum computer at utility scale consumes 25–100 kW — comparable to a small data center. The cost of energy will be a line item in quantum computing TCO by 2028.
3. **Competitive pressure:** As quantum platforms converge on gate fidelity (~99.9%), energy-per-solution becomes a differentiating metric — but only if measured on a common standard.

The entity that defines the standard **before** these forces crystallize owns the metric. The entity that defines it **after** is one vendor among many.

### 3.2 Competitive Positioning Matrix (Revised)

| Entity | Role in JPCUB Consortium | Incentive to Join | Risk of Alternative Standard |
|:-------|:-------------------------|:------------------|:----------------------------|
| **QWAV (steward)** | Metric development, data pipeline, consortium secretariat | Ownership of the standard; grant eligibility | — |
| **Academic members** | Validation, peer review, methodological rigor | Publication credit; access to benchmarking data | Low — academic incentives favor open standards |
| **Industry members (hardware)** | Provide hardware access for measurement; propose metric refinements | JPCUB-verified badge; procurement eligibility | Medium — may build internal benchmarks if consortium excludes them |
| **Industry members (end-users)** | Define procurement-relevant benchmark workloads | Objective comparison data for purchasing decisions | Low — procurement benefits from neutral standards |
| **Regulatory observers** | Standards pathway (IEEE, ISO, EU) | Regulatory compliance tool | Low — regulators prefer multi-stakeholder standards |
| **Competing standard (e.g., IBM Qiskit Runtime metrics)** | N/A (excluded from consortium) | N/A (competitive) | High — IBM has the distribution and resources to launch an alternative |

**Key insight:** The consortium's defensibility comes from **inclusion**. If IBM, Google, and Amazon are members, they have governance stake in the standard they helped create — and less incentive to fork it. If they are excluded, they build alternatives.

### 3.3 The Certification Model: JPCUB-Verified

The "product" in the consortium model is **certification**, not software:

- **JPCUB-Verified Hardware:** A badge certifying that a quantum processor's energy-per-solution has been measured according to the JPCUB protocol by the consortium's measurement pipeline
- **JPCUB-Verified Software:** A badge for algorithm implementations that report JPCUB scores with auditable methodology
- **JPCUB-Compliant Procurement:** A designation for RFPs that require JPCUB scores as evaluation criteria

Certification revenue comes from: (a) certification application fees (per-platform, modest — €500–2,000), (b) consortium membership dues (tiered by organization type), and (c) custom benchmarking services for enterprise procurement (consulting, not certification).

## 5. Grant-Funding Landscape

### 5.1 Funding Tiers

| Program | Funder | Amount Range | Duration | QWAV Fit | Deadline |
|:--------|:-------|:-------------|:---------|:---------|:---------|
| **EU Quantum Flagship — Quantum Internet/Software** | European Commission (Horizon Europe) | €2M–5M (consortium) | 3–4 years | ★★★★★ — energy benchmarking as cross-cutting quantum software infrastructure | Rolling (calls ~annual) |
| **NWO Open Competition — ENW** | Dutch Research Council (NWO) | €200K–400K (single PI) | 4 years | ★★★★ — fundamental research on ultrametric quantum computing | Rolling |
| **Quantum Delta NL — SME/Use-Case** | Dutch National Growth Fund | €50K–500K | 1–3 years | ★★★★ — Dutch-based quantum software; energy-efficiency use-case | Rolling |
| **Sloan Foundation — Energy & Environment** | Alfred P. Sloan Foundation | $200K–500K | 2–3 years | ★★★ — energy-efficiency benchmarking as public-interest infrastructure | Rolling (LOI first) |
| **Simons Foundation — Mathematics & Physical Sciences** | Simons Foundation | $100K–500K | 2–3 years | ★★★ — p-adic/ultrametric mathematical foundations | Rolling |
| **Mozilla Technology Fund — AI/Compute** | Mozilla | $50K–150K | 1 year | ★★★ — open benchmarking infrastructure | Annual |
| **NLnet Foundation** | NLnet (NGI) | €5K–50K | 6–12 months | ★★ — open-source benchmarking tooling | Rolling |

### 5.2 Funding Strategy

**Phase 1 (Months 1–6): Small grants for protocol development**
- Target: NLnet (€5K–50K) + NWO (€200K–400K, if eligible as independent researcher)
- Deliverable: JPCUB Protocol Specification v1.0, measurement pipeline alpha

**Phase 2 (Months 6–18): Consortium-building grant**
- Target: Quantum Delta NL SME/Use-Case (€50K–500K) or EU Quantum Flagship as coordinator of a small consortium (€2M–5M)
- Requires: ≥2 letters of intent from potential consortium members (academic or industry)
- Deliverable: JPCUB Consortium launched, ≥3 institutional members, certification framework beta

**Phase 3 (Months 18–36): Sustainability**
- Membership dues + certification fees cover operational costs
- Grant funding continues for core R&D (p-adic algorithms, protocol evolution)
- Target: €120K–400K/year combined (grants + membership + certification)

### 5.3 Grant vs. Investment

The consortium model is explicitly **not** a venture-capital path. Grant funding aligns with:

1. **Public-interest infrastructure:** A universal energy-efficiency benchmark is a public good — exactly what public research funding is designed to support
2. **Independent researcher profile:** Grant funding judges the research, not the business model; the founder's 15+ published papers and Zenodo corpus are directly relevant to grant applications
3. **Consortium neutrality:** A VC-backed benchmarking startup has the same trust problem as a single-vendor SaaS product; a grant-funded consortium steward does not

## 6. Consortium Governance Architecture

### 6.1 Membership Tiers

| Tier | Annual Dues | Voting Rights | Benefits | Target |
|:-----|:------------|:--------------|:---------|:-------|
| **Academic** | €0 (in-kind contribution: validation, peer review) | 1 vote per institution | Publication credit; early access to JPCUB data; co-authorship on consortium papers | 5–15 institutions |
| **Industry — Hardware** | €2,000–10,000 (scaled by organization size) | 1 vote per organization | JPCUB-verified badge eligibility; metric evolution input; certified benchmark data | 3–8 organizations |
| **Industry — End-User** | €1,000–5,000 | 1 vote per organization | Procurement tools; custom benchmark workload definition; certified data access | 3–10 organizations |
| **Regulatory Observer** | €0 (by invitation) | 0 votes (non-voting) | Standards pathway input; regulatory alignment review | 1–3 bodies |

### 6.2 Governance Bodies

1. **Steering Committee:** One representative per membership tier + QWAV (secretariat, tie-breaking vote). Meets quarterly. Ratifies metric changes, membership admissions, and certification rules.
2. **Technical Working Group:** Open to all members. Meets monthly. Develops measurement methodology, reviews benchmark data, proposes metric refinements.
3. **Certification Board:** Appointed by Steering Committee. Reviews and approves/denies JPCUB-verified badge applications. Independent of QWAV secretariat.

### 6.3 Consortium Launch Sequence

| Milestone | Timeline | Gate Condition |
|:----------|:---------|:---------------|
| **M0: Protocol v1.0 published** | Month 1–3 | JPCUB Protocol Specification on Zenodo, externally citable |
| **M1: Founding members** | Month 3–6 | ≥3 letters of intent (≥1 academic, ≥1 industry) |
| **M2: Charter ratified** | Month 6 | Consortium charter signed by all founding members |
| **M3: First certification** | Month 9–12 | ≥1 JPCUB-verified badge issued |
| **M4: Self-sustaining** | Month 18–24 | Operational costs covered by dues + certification fees |

## 7. Falsifiable Predictions (Revised)

Every strategic claim carries a pre-registered disconfirmation condition. Timestamped 2026-08-12.

| ID | Prediction | Check Date | Disconfirmation Condition | Strength |
|:---|:-----------|:-----------|:--------------------------|:---------|
| **GTM-1** | JPCUB cited in ≥1 external academic paper or industry report | 2027-02-12 | Zero external citations (excluding QNFO self-citations) | STRONG |
| **GTM-2** | ≥1 formal letter of intent from a potential consortium member (academic or industry) | 2027-02-12 | Zero letters of intent | STRONG |
| **GTM-3** | JPCUB Protocol Specification v1.0 published to Zenodo and publicly citable | 2027-02-12 | No published specification | STRONG |
| **GTM-4** | ≥3 institutional consortium members with signed charter | 2027-08-12 | Fewer than 3 signed members | STRONG |
| **GTM-5** | ≥1 JPCUB-verified badge issued to a hardware vendor | 2028-02-12 | Zero badges issued | MODERATE |
| **GTM-6** | ≥1 grant awarded (any amount from any recognized funder) | 2027-08-12 | Zero grant awards (applications submitted) | MODERATE |
| **GTM-7** | Competitor (IBM, Google, Amazon) announces energy benchmarking standard | 2027-08-12 | No competitor energy benchmarking by this date | STRONG (competitive response) |

**Revised GTM-4 replaces the SaaS revenue prediction.** The consortium membership count is the primary success metric. A consortium with ≥3 members is validated; zero members by 2027-08-12 falsifies the model.

## 8. Revenue and Financial Model (Combined)

### 8.1 Revenue Streams

| Stream | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Notes |
|:-------|:-------|:-------|:-------|:------|
| **Grant funding** | €50K–200K | €100K–400K | €100K–300K | Small grants first year; larger consortium grant second year |
| **Membership dues** | €0–6K | €10K–50K | €30K–100K | Zero in Year 1 (pre-consortium); scales with member count |
| **Certification fees** | €0 | €2K–10K | €10K–50K | Per-platform badge; scales with hardware vendor adoption |
| **Consulting** | €0–10K | €10K–50K | €20K–100K | Custom benchmarking for enterprise procurement |
| **Total** | **€50K–216K** | **€122K–510K** | **€160K–550K** | Wide range reflects consortium adoption uncertainty |

### 8.2 Cost Structure

| Category | Annual Cost | Notes |
|:---------|:------------|:------|
| Cloud infrastructure (Cloudflare Workers, R2, D1) | €500–2,000 | Current spend ~€50/mo; scales with benchmark data pipeline |
| Consortium operations (meetings, platform, legal) | €5,000–15,000 | Charter drafting, virtual meetings, certification platform |
| Travel (conferences, consortium meetings) | €3,000–8,000 | 2–4 conferences/year; 1–2 in-person consortium meetings |
| Research time (founder stipend) | €40,000–80,000 | Partial salary; below market rate for quantum computing researcher |
| **Total** | **€48,500–105,000** | |

Sustainability is achievable at the lower bound of Year 2 revenue. The model is lean by design — no office, no employees, no fundraising overhead.

### 8.3 Comparison: Grant-Funded Consortium vs. VC-Backed Startup

| | Grant-Funded Consortium | VC-Backed Startup |
|:--|:------------------------|:------------------|
| **Funding source** | Public research funding + membership dues | Venture capital |
| **Governance** | Multi-stakeholder (neutral steward) | Founder/board controlled |
| **Exit expectation** | None (public-good infrastructure) | Acquisition or IPO (5–10 years) |
| **Trust signal** | Neutral standards body | Vendor with investors |
| **Competitive risk** | Incumbents join consortium | Incumbents build alternative |
| **Alignment with founder** | RESEARCHER building a standard | FOUNDER building a company |

---

## 9. Risk Assessment

| Risk | Category | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|:-----|:---------|:-----------|:-------|:-----------|
| Consortium fails to attract founding members | Organizational | Medium (50%) | Critical | Start with academic members (low barrier); industry follows academic validation |
| Incumbent launches competing standard | Competitive | High (70%) | Medium | Invite incumbents to join; a competing standard from a member is governance-hostile |
| Grant applications rejected | Funding | Medium (40%) | High | Apply to ≥5 programs; small grants (NLnet, Mozilla) have higher success rates than large (EU Flagship) |
| Founder bandwidth bottleneck | Operational | High (90%) | Medium | Consortium distributes work; grant funding covers partial salary |
| Certification model fails to gain traction | Market | Medium (40%) | Medium | Certification is a premium layer; core value is the consortium data and standard |
| Regulatory energy mandates delayed | Market | Medium (30%) | Low | JPCUB adoption precedes regulation — early-adopter HPC centers adopt for procurement advantage |
| Free-rider problem | Organizational | Medium (50%) | Low | Membership benefits (voting, data access, certification eligibility) require dues; free-riders get public data only |

### 9.1 Key Risk: Consortium Formation Critical Mass

The single largest risk is organizational: the consortium must achieve critical mass (≥3 members) before incumbents launch competing standards. The consortium model's defensibility comes from inclusion — but that requires members. The first members are the hardest to recruit.

Mitigations:
1. **Academic-first strategy:** Academic members join at zero cost and receive publication credit — a low-barrier first tier that builds legitimacy
2. **Pre-formation validation:** Publish JPCUB Protocol Specification v1.0 as a single-author work first, establishing the metric's methodological credibility before asking members to join
3. **Grant-funded core:** The consortium secretariat (QWAV) is funded by grants during the formation phase, removing the chicken-and-egg problem of "need members to fund operations, need operations to attract members"

---

## 10. Conclusion

The SaaS model — a single independent researcher selling a benchmarking product to quantum hardware vendors and enterprise buyers — faces a structural trust deficit and a competitive window of 12–36 months. The consortium model transforms JPCUB from a product into a standard, and positions QWAV as the neutral steward of a metric that the quantum computing industry will need regardless of which hardware architecture wins.

The combined strategy is:

1. **Grant-funded core R&D** (Years 1–2): JPCUB protocol development, measurement pipeline, p-adic algorithm research — funded by NWO, Quantum Delta NL, NLnet, and EU programs
2. **Consortium formation** (Year 1): Academic founding members → industry members → regulatory observers → ratified charter → first certifications
3. **Certification revenue** (Year 2+): JPCUB-verified badges as the "product" — a credential, not a subscription
4. **Sustainability** (Year 2–3): Combined grant + membership + certification revenue covers operational costs

The seven pre-registered predictions anchor this strategy in falsifiable terms. If the consortium has fewer than three members by 2027-08-12, the model is falsified and a pivot to grant-only R&D or a narrower SaaS product is warranted. If the predictions hold, QWAV captures a defensible position as the steward of the energy-efficiency standard for quantum computing — a position that survives incumbent competition because it is built on inclusion, not exclusion.
