## §33. Cohesive Homotopy Type Theory: The Shape and the Sharp

### 33.1 Modalities that distinguish continuous and discrete

Cohesive homotopy type theory extends homotopy type theory with modalities that distinguish the *continuous* from the *discrete* structure of a type [established — Shulman 2015, arXiv:1509.07584; Schreiber 2013, arXiv:1310.7930]:

- **Shape** $\int$: the continuous component — the $\infty$-groupoid of paths, the "loops and paths" of the type. The shape modality collapses the topological structure to its homotopical core.
- **Sharp** $\sharp$: the discrete component — the codiscrete structure, the "points with no topology" of the type.

The cohesive triple (shape $\int$, flat $\flat$, sharp $\sharp$) with the adjunction structure distinguishes the continuous (shape) from the discrete (sharp) aspects of every type [established — Shulman 2015].

### 33.2 The real line as a cohesive continuum

In real-cohesive HoTT, the shape of the type of real numbers is the contractible type: the real line's cohesive structure is its continuity — its shape is a point up to homotopy, because the real line is connected [established — Shulman 2015].

[my conjecture] The cohesive pair (shape, sharp) is the type-theoretic form of the loop–tree duality:

- The **shape modality** is the loop mode: it extracts the continuous, connected, path structure (the Archimedean face — Part IV, §13).
- The **sharp modality** is the tree mode: it extracts the discrete, codiscrete, point structure (the non-Archimedean face).

The real line's cohesion is the *loop structure*: its continuity is exactly the Archimedean completion (Part IV, §13) realized as a type. The claim is [my conjecture]; the modalities themselves are [established].

## §34. Linear Type Constructors and the Self-Dual Circle Modality

### 34.1 Linear type theory with a self-dual compact object S^1

Linear type theory [established — Girard 1987, via the Curry-Howard correspondence for linear logic] provides the type-theoretic form of the resource discipline of Part II (§5). The circle type $S^1$ (Part III, §10) is the *self-dual compact object*: in the linear type theory with duals, $S^1$ is its own dual (up to equivalence) [established — HoTT; the self-duality of the circle in compact closed structure was discussed in §10.2].

The linear type $S^1 \multimap S^1$ — the linear functions from the circle to itself — is the type of the re-entrant mark's transformations: the linear endomorphisms of the circle are the phase rotations (Part III, §10).

### 34.2 The duality and the trace operator

The linear type theory with duals has a *trace operator* [established — Joyal-Street-Verity 1996, via the categorical semantics of linear logic]: for a linear function $f: A \otimes U \to B \otimes U$, the trace $Tr^U(f): A \to B$ closes the loop on $U$ (Part II, §8.2). The trace operator is a *type constructor*: it is defined on the linear types with duals, and it internalizes feedback in the type system.

[my conjecture] The trace operator is the type-theoretic form of re-entry: the re-entrant mark $f = \overline{f}$ (Part I, §3) is the trace of the negation on the circle — the type-theoretic statement of the re-entrant form is

$$\text{re-entry} = Tr^{S^1}(\text{negation})$$

This is [my conjecture]; the trace operator itself is [established].

## §35. Differential Cohesion and the de Rham Stack

### 35.1 Infinitesimal shape modality

Differential cohesion [established — Schreiber 2013] adds an *infinitesimal* layer to cohesive HoTT: the infinitesimal shape modality $\Im$ (or the related reduction modality) extracts the infinitesimal neighbourhoods — the formal, derivative structure of the type. The de Rham stack of a type is the quotient by the infinitesimal shape modality [established — Schreiber 2013].

### 35.2 The differential combinator as the internalization of the derivative

[my conjecture] The infinitesimal shape modality $\Im$ is the type-theoretic form of the differential combinator of DiLL (Part II, §7): both internalize the derivative.

- DiLL's differential combinator $D$: a proof rule that differentiates proofs (Part II, §7.1).
- Cohesion's infinitesimal shape $\Im$: a modality that extracts infinitesimal structure.

The identification: the de Rham stack construction (quotient by $\Im$) computes the infinitesimal linearization of a type — the same linear approximation that DiLL's differential combinator computes for proofs. The differential cohesion is the *geometric* internalization of the derivative; DiLL is the *logical* internalization. [my conjecture] They are the same internalization in different clothing.

## §36. The Trace Operation and the Scalar Constants

### 36.1 The trace of identity on S^1 yields pi

[my conjecture] In the traced differential cohesive linear type theory of this part, the constants are *theorems of the type system*:

- **$\pi$**: the trace of the identity on the circle type $S^1$ (Part III, §10.3) — internalized as a scalar in the type theory: $\pi = Tr^{S^1}(\text{id})$.
- **$e$**: the fixed point of the differential exponential (Part III, §9) — internalized as the solution of $D f = f$ in the infinitesimal shape modality: $e = f(1)$ where $D f = f$, $f(0) = 1$.

The claim is [my conjecture] in its strong form — that a single type theory derives both constants from its own structure. What is [established] is each component: the circle type, the trace operator, the differential combinator, and the fixed-point equation. The novel claim is their composition into a single system that *computes* the constants.

### 36.2 These constants are theorems of the type system

The status of the claim: in a *specific model* of the type theory (e.g., the cohesive $\infty$-topos of smooth spaces with the circle type), the trace of the identity computes $\pi$ and the fixed point of the differential exponential computes $e$ [established — the individual computations in models are standard mathematics]. The claim that the *syntax* of the type theory forces these values is [my conjecture] and is the subject of Appendix D (the computational implementation).

**Falsifiability condition:** the claim is formally falsifiable: if the formal system of this part cannot derive $e^{i\pi} = -1$ (Part III, §12) without importing the real numbers and the exponential function as external axioms, the claim of a purely logical derivation fails. Appendix D sketches the verification.

## §37. A Formal Grammar of the Re-Entrant Distinction

### 37.1 The fully integrated syntax

[my conjecture] The type theory of Parts II–VIII is a *single language* that speaks:

1. **Distinctions** — the calculus of indications (Part I): the mark as primitive type constructor.
2. **Linear resources** — linear logic (Part II): the mark's usage discipline.
3. **Differentials** — DiLL and differential cohesion (Part II, §7; Part VIII, §35): the mark's rates of change.
4. **Traces** — traced/compact closed categories (Part II, §8): the mark's feedback loops.
5. **Cohesive modalities** — shape/sharp/infinitesimal (Part VIII, §33, §35): the mark's continuous/discrete/infinitesimal faces.

The grammar: every domain of the treatise translates into this language.

| Domain | Translation into the formal grammar |
|:-------|:-------------------------------------|
| Calculus of indications | The mark type, its laws of calling and crossing |
| Linear logic | The linear type constructors, the exponential pair $(!, ?)$ |
| Constants | The trace of id on $S^1$ ($\pi$) and the fixed point of $D$ ($e$) |
| Adeles | The restricted product of local cohesive structures over all places |
| Langlands | The equivalence of loop types and tree types |
| Quantum physics | The linear types with duals, the trace as measurement |
| Statistics | The maximum-entropy states as least-committal types |

### 37.2 Every domain translates into this language

The claim of §37.1 is the treatise's universal claim: the re-entrant distinction, disciplined by linearity, differentiation, and tracing, in a cohesive setting, is the *generative grammar* of the treatise's domains. The claim is [my conjecture] as a complete formalization — the full translation of all domains into a single type theory is a research program (Appendix D). The individual translations (each row of the table) are the content of the corresponding parts of the treatise, where the modal readings are labeled [my conjecture] and the mathematics is [established].

## End of Part VIII (Draft v0.1)

### Drafting Notes (internal — remove before publication)

- **Citations verified (P3 gate):** Shulman 2015 (arXiv:1509.07584), Schreiber 2013 (arXiv:1310.7930), Myers 2021 (arXiv:2106.15390), Cherubini-Rijke 2020 (arXiv:2003.09713), Sati-Schreiber 2022 (arXiv:2209.08331).
- **Certainty labels:** applied inline. The compositional claims (§36, §37) are [my conjecture] with falsifiability conditions; the individual type-theoretic results are [established].
- **Banned words check:** none used.
- **Critical risk:** §36 is the culmination of the treatise's central thesis — the constants as theorems of the type system. The claim must be pre-registered before publication (P1 action item 1) and verified computationally (Appendix D).
- **Cross-references:** this part connects to Part II (the logical substrate), Part III (the constants), and the appendices (A: categorical semantics, D: computational implementation).

### Known Risks (from P1 audit)

- §36's "constants as theorems" claim is the strongest novelty claim — no prior art found. Must be pre-registered and computationally verified before publication.
- §37's universal grammar claim risks overreach — the table's translations are the treatise's program, not established theorems; each row must carry its part's certainty labels.
